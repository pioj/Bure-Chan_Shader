# Bure-Chan_Shader
Smart Shader that uses any of the RGBA channels of a Texture as Albedo, supports Blend Modes.

*(Sorry, no GIF available yet!)*
 
### Overview
 This Shader is based on the technique of combining multiple images/textures as R,G,B & A channels into a single Texture.
 In practice, each channel can be then repurposed as a gray-based Texture.
 So you can combine the texture information with a solid color or a gradient.

### Guidelines
For the Texture to work please follow this guide: http://wiki.polycount.com/wiki/ChannelPacking

**NOTE:** This tool **will NOT** combine the texture for you. There are a few Image software that allow to combine multiple images into RGBA channels.
 
  
### Instructions
 1. Create a material that refers to **Evolis3D/Burechan**.
 2. Apply the material to any mesh you want.

### Planned Features
 - Make a variant of the Shader for Sprites/UI?
